# PSMC Reposity

This repository is primarily for the development of PSMC (Papaw's Son Media Center), a fork of XBMC/Kodi Media Center.

• <B>PSMC 18</B> (forked from Kodi 18.2)


The addons here have been modded/themed for and tested tested with PSMC, as well as Kodi 18 and appear to be working fine unless otherwise stated. They include:

• <B>PSMC Maintenance Tools</B> (Maintenance Program)
• <B>Various Skins</B> (Skins themed for PSMC 18 and work fine with XBMC/Kodi 18)

• PSMC Maintenance Tools - Features include: Auto delete of cache at start up (optional), notifies when packages and thumbs reach a set amount of wasted storage space (you can set and change sizes), cuts down on your devices read/writes on the ROM. Also has many Backup/Restore Options, Speed test, IP check and other features. Again, please give credit to their respective developers.

• The various Skins were themed from Aeon Nox SiLVO 7.0.1

PSMC and the addons here are 3rd party addons, so please do not seek help from Kodi, the Kodi forums, etc..
