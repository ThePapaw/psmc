# PSMC Reposity

This repository is primarily for the development of PSMC (Papaw's Son Media Center), a fork of XBMC/Kodi Media Center.

• <B>PSMC 18</B> (forked from Kodi 18.2) - coming soon


The addons here have been created, modded and/or themed for using with PSMC. They also work fine with Kodi 18 unless otherwise stated. They include:

• <B>PSMC Maintenance Tools</B> (Maintenance Program)<BR>
Features include: Auto delete of cache at start up (optional), notifies when packages and thumbs reach a set amount of wasted storage space (you can set and change sizes), cuts down on your devices read/writes on the ROM. Also has many Backup/Restore Options, Speed test, IP check and other features. Again, please give credit to their respective developers.

The skins here have been created, modded and/or themed for using with PSMC. They also work fine with Kodi 18 and were all themed from Aeon Nox SiLVO 7.0.1. unless otherwise stated. They include:

• <B>PSMC Silvo Skin</B> (Modded from Aeon Nox SiLVO 7.0.1 for PSMC/Kodi v18)<BR>
• <B>PSMC's Spiderman</B> (Spiderman Theme for PSMC/Kodi v18)

PSMC, the addons & skins are considered 3rd party, so please do not seek help from Kodi, the Kodi forums, etc..

If you have issues, please post them here. All items are still being developed and should only be used for testing purposes.
