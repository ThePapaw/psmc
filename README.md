# PSMC Reposity

This repository is for the development of PSMC (Papaw's Son Media Center), a fork of XBMC/Kodi Media Center.

All items are still being developed and should only be used for testing purposes. Please do NOT post or link too Youtube, social media or any other web sites without gaining approval first.

The addons here have been tested with PSMC (fork of Kodi v18.2) and appear to be working fine unless otherwise stated.

PSMC and the addons here are 3rd party addons, so please do not seek help from Kodi, the Kodi forums, etc..

If you have issues, please post them here. All items are still being developed and should only be used for testing purposes.
